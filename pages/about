<p>8-Bit Gainz was started with the idea that all gamer’s can live a life of endless gaming  hours and also maintain a healthy body. It was also started with the idea that not everyone who lifts weights is a monstrous, juice head, protein thirsty, grunting asshole (Although those exist).  Hosted by Mark H. and Bryce F. Two best friends who stayed connected via Video games and Iron. The show is a 40 – 70 minute video game  weight lifting bro fest and we’d like to invite you! We may not always stay on topic, We may not always talk about great games, But we’ll certainly get a laugh or two out of you.
		  Thanks for dropping by and hope you enjoy the show!</p>
